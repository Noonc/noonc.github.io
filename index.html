<p>Howdy, <br> My personal projects. <a href="https://github.com/Noonc/Noon-Video-Downloader">Video Downloader</a> - this was my first big project I worked on to learn C# and coding. <br> 
  I found <a href="https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html">youtube-dl</a> one day and wanted to have a GUI application to use with it. After not finding many options I liked or that worked, I decided to build my own. <br>
  My next bigger personal project was <a href="https://github.com/Noonc/AdminInventory">Admin Inventory </a>. This was a project I worked on in Java. Technically Java was my first language I learned when I decided I wanted to create a minecraft mod. <br>
  Overtime I started to make very simple plugins for Bukkit servers. Recently, I went back to Minecraft for a while and was hosting a Bungeecord server. I needed a way to transport items between servers. I found a plugin that worked, but not for my needs. <br>
  Eventually, my inital needs changed and I got the idea of making an admin/dev inventory utility. I also started to learn about SQL Databases as I used them for this plugin. <br>
  Finally, I am currently working on a website to enhance my general knowledge of various languages. </p>
